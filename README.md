MovieLens Recommendation System

HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate: PH125.9x

This project was created within the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate. The objective of capstone-movielens project was to develop and an algorithm for a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens 10M dataset such that it was able to predict ratings with a residual mean square error of less than 0.86490.

This report discusses a few methods used to construct recommendation systems. The best performing model is matrix factorization which yields an RMSE of 0.7867 when trained on edx and tested on validation. This is an improvement on the first modelâ€™s RMSE by around 25.81%
